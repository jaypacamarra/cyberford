RPI -> Arduino motor controller[AMC] (asynchronous / 10Hz)


Sequence:

1	TaskRPiControl (locked)
2 	ISR (unlocks RPiControl)
3	TaskRPiControl (unlocked)
4	Parse data from SPI line
5	Lock TaskRPiControl
6	Back to 1

byte format (for reference):
bit7 | bit6 | bit5 | bit4 | bit3 | bit2 | bit1 | bit0

RPI 8-byte command format:
byte	0-5	  6 ASCII characters in sequence that spell out "CyberF"
byte	6	    the command ID corresponding to the command enum defined in CyberFord.h
byte	7	    Command value ranging from 0-255	
		

Command processing requirements:
- Arduino controller shall receive command inputs at a frequnecy of 10Hz
- Each command shall be entered into a queue construct in the AMC software
- Command processing on the AMC shall take no more than 50 milliseconds
- The TaskRPiControl task shall only do its functions when the
  interrupt unblocks the task which will process the data received via SPI
