RPI -> Arduino motor controller[AMC] (asynchronous / 10Hz)


Sequence:

1	TaskRPiControl (locked)
2 	ISR (unlocks RPiControl)
3	TaskRPiControl (unlocked)
4	save command ID and value
5	Lock TaskRPiControl
6	Back to 1

byte format (for reference):
bit7 | bit6 | bit5 | bit4 | bit3 | bit2 | bit1 | bit0

RPI 8-byte command format:
byte	0	    the command ID corresponding to the command enum defined in CyberFord.h
byte	1	    Command value ranging from 0-255	
		

Command processing requirements:
- Arduino controller shall receive command inputs at a frequnecy of 10Hz
- The TaskRPiControl task shall only do its functions when the
  interrupt unblocks the task which will process the data received via SPI
- Light control task takes no more than 5 milliseconds
- Logging task takes no more than 10 milliseconds
- Motor control task takes no more than 5 milliseconds
- RPi control task takes no more than 1 milliseconds
- Steering control task takes no more than 2 milliseconds
